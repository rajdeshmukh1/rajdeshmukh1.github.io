Hello! I am a software engineer in the Perception R&D team at Plus, located in the South Bay Area, California. My work typically focuses on design and implementation for perception modules (specifically, lane detection and tracking) for software-based autonomy solutions, which is an integral component of their [PlusVision](https://plus.ai/solutions/plusvision) deliverables. Prior to this, I was a part of the Object Fusion team at [APTIV](https://www.aptiv.com/en/solutions/adas) which forms a vital component of their Active Safety product. I earned my Ph.D. and masters in the [Flight Dynamics & Control/ Hybrid Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fdchsl/home) at Purdue University, and my bachelors degree at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.ae.iitkgp.ac.in/). During all my degrees, I have majored in aerospace/aeronautical engineering, with a focus on state estimation, control theory, and applied machine learning.

The [research page](/research) provides an extensive overview of the investigations I have conducted throughout my graduate studies, with a specific emphasis on distributed state estimation and applied machine learning. All publications stemming from these research endeavors can be found on the [publications page](/publications). An account of my experiences at Plus and Aptiv is presented on the [work experience page](/work). This entire narrative is succinctly encapsulated in my CV, accessible through the [CV page](/cv).

During my leisure hours, I engage in amateur tennis, basketball, badminton, and squash. With the pandemic curbing these activities, some friends and I have got a newfound interest in playing board games and tabletop RPG games. It has been a slippery slope of buying newer and more complex games, which has led to a never-ending race between buying new games (just got Food Chain Magnate!), and playing them all; the list of games I own and have played can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/chocopie9). I am the DM for several D&D campaigns, wield the powers of a chaotic Paladin in one ([smite!](/images/smite.jpg)) and a charming Swords Bard in BG3 ([lute!](/images/lute.jpg)). I also try to play some guitar and the bass, and enjoy listening to prog.
